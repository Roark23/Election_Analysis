- There were 369,711 total votes cast in the congressional election.

    - Jefferson county had 38,885 votes accounting for 10.5% of the total votes.
    - Denver county recrded 306,055 votes accumulating 82.8% of the total votes.
    - Arapahoe county accounted for the remaing 24,801 votes making up 6.7% of the total votes.
- It's evident Denver accounted for most of the votes for a county.

### Election Candidate Results
- We need to understand who won the election and the breakdown of the votes casted for each candidate in the election:
    - Charles Casper Stockham recorded 85,213 votes for 23% of the total votes.
    - Diana Degette earned 272,892 votes accounting for 73.8% of the total votes.
    - Raymon Anthony Doane received 11,606 votes accumulating 3.1% of the total votes.

- It's clear that Diana Degette won the election with a total vote count of 272,892. She won by a landslide earning 73.8% of all the votes casted for the election.

## Election-Audit Summary
The election commision should use this Python script for future elections. The script can be modified for any election.
### 1)
This script can be modified to account for different counties. The script could be modified to account for more or less counties in an election.
### 2)
It can also account for different cadidates. The script could possibly analyze many more candidates for an election. It can also be modified to only look at a couple candidates. Overall, the script is written in a way where we can modify the number of counties and cadidates we want to analyze for any election.
